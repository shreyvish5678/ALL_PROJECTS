The agglomerative clustering is the most common type of hierarchical clustering used to group objects in clusters based on their similarity. Itâ€™s also known as AGNES (Agglomerative Nesting). The algorithm starts by treating each object as a singleton cluster. Next, pairs of clusters are successively merged until all clusters have been merged into one big cluster containing all objects. The result is a tree-based representation of the objects, named dendrogram.
